# Thesis
This contains a well annotated jupyter notebook with all the relevant code used in the project. 
Please note that directories and keys have been anonimized within the notebooks.

## The project consists of 6 chapters:

1. Sampling V1; Here we sample videos based on channel ids and select them for further analysis, using the YouTube API.
2. Sampling V2 (Omitted)
3. Statistics Retrieval; Here we use the YouTube API to find video statistics such as like count, age, etc.
4. Transcription; Here we first use youtube-dl to download audio tracks which we then transcribe using the IBM Watson Speech to Text api
5. Natural Language Processing; Here we define our features and process our data.

The analysis portion of the thesis has not been included since it is completely tailored to my thesis but is available upon request. 
The same goes for the complete document.
